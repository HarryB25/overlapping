## Introduction

The goal of this project is to implement and provide tools for large-scale decision-making by recognizing personas across different communities. The code includes community discovery algorithms, collaborative representation methods, and clustering techniques for effective persona identification.

## Dependencies

To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Folder Structure

- **utils/**: Contains code for various community discovery algorithms.
- **ARface.py**: Calculates collaborative representations on the ar.mat dataset using the co-representation approach.
- **ar.mat**: Dataset used by ARface.py for computation.
- **assessment.xlsx**: Data file containing assessment information.
- **cluster.py**: Utilizes collaborative representation for calculations on the assessment.xlsx dataset and performs clustering on the constructed network.
- **consensus.py**: Provides a visual representation of optimization algorithms.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarryB25/overlapping.git
cd overlapping
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run ARface.py:

```bash
python ARface.py
```

4. Run cluster.py:
